A trellis I built to give support for the hops I planted outside my office window.

I made the trellis from two layers of cedar, with some metal mesh sandwiched in the middle.

I made the trellis long so I could use the feet to secure it to the ground, and a little angle bracket to anchor the top to the soffit.

In the summer it fills out completly with hops which gives great shade to the office.  In the winter it is wide open letting in the sunlight.
