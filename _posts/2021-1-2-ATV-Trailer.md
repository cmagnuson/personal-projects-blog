An ATV trailer for hauling stuff around my friends property.  <!--more--> After becoming the proud owner of a [Burger King Play Place]({% post_url 2020-12-21-Free-Play-Place %}) last December, I knew I'd need a better trailer to move the units around my friends property with.

I was looking for something with lots of places to strap items down to, and wide enough to fit all the playground pieces.

Measuring the hitch height on my friends ATV.  Too low, but with an adaptor I think it will be ok.  Hoping the whatever caused it to bend in the past and become "too low" doesn't continue to happen...

I stole the wheels from a somewhat junked trailer on site, and measured the axle.  For some reason I convinced myself it was 5/8" and didn't bother to put a caliper on the wheel. Some returns later, I had a 3/4" rod for my new axle.

Working on the supports for the axle.

Axle in place and wheels on.  I tried to space the wheels the same as the ATV's wheelbase - this should mean the trailer corners similar to the ATV, and will also ensure it can fit across two bridges I built last summer - they are built exactly to fit this ATV.

The ball coupler attached and ready to be brought out to my friends property. I used 1" steel tube and the coupler is built for 2", so I padded it out with some wood before bolting it in place, I figured some more bearing surface wouldn't hurt things.

Unfortunately the tires are not highway rated, nor am I confident enough in my trailer design and welding to take it on the road anyways.  So I'll have to haul it out in a vehicle instead behind it.

I'd like to paint it now, but we won't have warm enough weather until the spring, so finishing it up will have to wait a while.
