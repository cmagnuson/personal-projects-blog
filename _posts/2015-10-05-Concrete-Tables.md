I built a couple of concrete tables for outdoor counter space when cooking.

I made a melamine form for the concrete and set some bolts which I would use to anchor it to a wood base.

After releasing the concrete from its form I flipped it over and gave it a sand and rounded over the rough edges.

Installed on a base - this one didn't involve any joinery, just screws and treated lumber.  I brought this out to my friends property for a sturdy outdoor counter.

Here is a smaller one I built to fit my pizza oven, with mortise and tenon joints. There are wheels for moving it around and room to store a propane tank underneath.

Here's a larger table I made for preparing the pizzas, also with mortise and tenon joints, and wheeled legs.
