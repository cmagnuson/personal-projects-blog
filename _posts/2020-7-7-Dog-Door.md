A door in the fence for our dog Moby to look out of.

Since he has a lot of free time on his hands, he likes to look out at the street under the fence gate, we thought we could improve the setup.

I made a square hole in the gate, but did not square up the gate itself... so everything looks a little tilty.  Then I made a little window out of some scrap cedar and installed it.

We decided we liked the clean look without a latch better, so I embedded magnets in the door, the frame, and the larger fence door. This holds the door in place in the opened and closed positions.  If I'd planned to use magnets from the beginning I would have attached them from the opposite sides of all the wood so they were completly concealed.  This wasn't possible however with the door and frame already built and installed.

It took Moby a couple of days to get used to his new window, but now he loves it!
