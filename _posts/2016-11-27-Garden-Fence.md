I built a fence around our raised beds to keep animals (mostly our dog) out.

This replaced some chicken wire surrounding the beds, which didn't look very nice and was a pain to step over when gardening.

I made some rectangular frames using cedar and pocket screws. On the backside of the frame I stapled on a metal mesh. This was a pretty quick process.

I put hinges and latches on the panels going between each bed, so it is easy to access still.
