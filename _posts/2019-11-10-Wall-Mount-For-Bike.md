I built a wall mount for my bike to be able to store it inside but out of the way.

I made the mount out of a piece of oak that I cut a bevel around the sides to make the edges softer.  I bought a simple metal mount for a bike, measured it's dimensions and used my CNC to cut a matching hole in the wood base.

I cut a matching rectangular piece on my table saw to the CNC cut hole, and  used a chisel to recess the metal mount into the rectangular piece.

I drilled three holes for drywall anchors.  I countersunk the head of the anchors, and cut matching sized plugs so I could conceal the holes.

After installing the mount on the wall I put a tiny amount of glue on each hole and tapped the plug in.  I cut the plug flush with a pull saw.  I didn't want to secure the plug too tightly - in case I need to remove the assembly from the wall in the future - I'll have to remove the plug to access the drywall screws.
