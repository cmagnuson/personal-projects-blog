A very large Seesaw I built for fun.
<!--more-->

I built this Seesaw to bring out to my friends recreational property in Wisconsin.  I don't recall the exact dimensions, but I think it is about 20' long.  I cut a circular hole in the middle of the main beam and installed a galvanized pipe as a pivot.

I built the base in my basement out of 4x and 2x material.

It turned out to be quite heavy, so I had to ratchet it up the steps.

I installed a U shaped pipe handle by both seats.

Overall it has worked well.

The base is rather narrow, but less tippy then I'd expected when used on level ground.  I would next time pour some concrete or stake it in with rebar.

The handles could use some padding - as you can get pretty airborne and come crashing down on the seat, and need to hold on tight.
