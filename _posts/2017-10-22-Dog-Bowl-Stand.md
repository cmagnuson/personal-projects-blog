I built a stand for our dog Moby's food and water dishes.

Since he is a tall dog it is easier on his body to be able to eat without stooping over.  I glued up a board to get the width I needed, traced the bowls and cut out holes for them with a jigsaw.  The bowls have enough lip to hide any uneven cutting I did.

It is also easier on us, as we can fill and wash his bowls easier without bending over as well.
